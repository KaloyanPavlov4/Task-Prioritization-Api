Generate 50 sample task entries in JSON format for testing purposes. Include fields like task name, description, priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW), completion status, and due date.  (I needed mock data to test my system and ensure it handled real-world scenarios. AI provided a well-structured JSON output that I could use to populate my database for testing.)

Refactor this Java Spring Boot controller code to handle exception handling globally and ensure cleaner, more readable code. Add custom error responses for different exceptions, such as resource not found or validation errors. (I wanted to improve the readability and maintainability of my code. AI provided a refactored version with global exception handling and clear error messages)

Help me write test cases for my REST API that handles tasks, including edge cases like invalid data, empty inputs. I am using JUnit and Spring Test for my unit tests. (I needed AI to generate comprehensive test cases that would cover various scenarios, ensuring my REST API was well-tested and free of bugs.)
<br/>
Generate API documentation for the following endpoints: GET /tasks, POST /tasks, PUT /tasks/{taskId}, DELETE /tasks/{taskId}. Include descriptions for the parameters, expected responses and examples (I wanted to automate the generation of clean and well-structured API documentation.)
<br/>
Create a Dockerfile to containerize my Spring Boot application. The app uses Java 17 and PostgreSQL. It should expose port 8080. (For running the application with Docker)
